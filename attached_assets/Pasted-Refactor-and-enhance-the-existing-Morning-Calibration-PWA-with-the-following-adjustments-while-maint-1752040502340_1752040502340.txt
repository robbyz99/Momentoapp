Refactor and enhance the existing Morning Calibration PWA with the following adjustments while maintaining mobile-first, smooth animations, localStorage persistence, and PWA readiness:

Feature Enhancements:

✅ 1. Breathing & Gratitude Priming (First Step):
	•	Add a “Take 3 deep breaths and feel gratitude” animation with a breathing circle (5 sec in, 5 sec out, 3 cycles) and a sunrise or nature GIF to wire the brain for positivity before intention/goal setting.
	•	Allow skipping if the user is in a rush.

✅ 2. Power Phrase Welcome:
	•	Replace generic “Morning Calibration” with:
“✨ Today, you get to choose who you will be and what you will create.”
	•	Add:
“Set your intention and your goals so your day moves you closer to who you want to become.”

✅ 3. Starter Action Suggestion Generator:
	•	In the “What tiny starter action will I take?” section, add a “Need ideas?” button that cycles suggested starter actions to reduce friction on low-energy days.

✅ 4. “Why Today Matters” Field:
	•	Add a prompt:
“Why is it important for me to show up today?”
	•	Store this with the daily entry.

✅ 5. Streak Tracker (Visible):
	•	Show “Day X of showing up for yourself” prominently.
	•	Increment automatically when “Complete Morning Setup” is tapped.
	•	Add a subtle confetti micro-animation or color pulse when streak is extended.

✅ 6. Micro Visualization After Setup:
	•	After “Complete Morning Setup,” guide user through a 15-second micro-visualization:
“✨ Take 15 seconds to imagine yourself at the end of today, having achieved your goals, feeling proud, calm, and grateful.”
	•	Include a countdown timer, optional nature sound toggle, and a “Done” button to confirm.

✅ 7. Aesthetic Refinements:
	•	Apply a warm sunrise gradient (soft orange, peach, blush pink) to the top header or background for warmth.
	•	Use rounded, friendly sans-serif fonts (Nunito or Inter) for comfort.
	•	Retain smooth animations, with gentle scale or fade transitions.

Technical Notes:
	•	Continue using localStorage for data persistence.
	•	All new fields should sync with the JSON schema provided below.
	•	Ensure full offline functionality remains intact.
	•	Maintain PWA installability.
	•	Retain optional evening reflection workflow and weekly export functionality.
