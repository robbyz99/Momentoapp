Please refactor and enhance the Morning Momentum App (a mobile-first PWA for morning mindfulness and productivity priming using neuroscience-based behavioral design) to align with the following feature, UX, and growth improvements:

‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Timer + Breathing Section
	‚Ä¢	Combine the current Breathing & Gratitude section and Timer section into a single ‚ÄúBreathe & Center‚Äù screen.
	‚Ä¢	Features:
	‚Ä¢	3-cycle breathing animation with instructions.
	‚Ä¢	Optional extended timer (2-5 min) with circular SVG progress and motivational messaging.
	‚Ä¢	Allow user to skip extended timer for flexibility.
	‚Ä¢	Track completion status in the database/localStorage.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Optional Quick Mode
	‚Ä¢	On the Welcome Screen, add:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIn a rush? Try Quick Mode (2 min)‚Äù button.
	‚Ä¢	Quick Mode should:
	‚Ä¢	Capture identity statement, 1-word gratitude, starter action (auto-suggested), and ‚Äúwhy today matters.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	End with a confetti celebration.
	‚Ä¢	Bypass other screens for busy days while maintaining streak.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build Soft Onboarding Flow
	‚Ä¢	On first launch:
	‚Ä¢	Multi-screen onboarding:
	1.	Welcome & benefits of the app.
	2.	What to expect (short, intentional steps).
	3.	Quick Mode or Full Mode choice.
	4.	Enable optional notifications for daily reminders.
	‚Ä¢	Use warm sunrise gradients, short, motivational copy.
	‚Ä¢	Allow skipping onboarding if desired.
	‚Ä¢	Save onboarding completion status.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Add Streak Recovery System
	‚Ä¢	If a user misses a day:
	‚Ä¢	Show a gentle prompt:
‚ÄúYou missed yesterday, but your journey continues. Want to restore your streak with a quick reflection?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Allow 1 ‚Äúgrace day‚Äù per week with a reflection or gratitude input to recover streak.

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Growth Hooks
	‚Ä¢	At streak milestones (7, 21, 50 days):
	‚Ä¢	Show a celebration modal with:
	‚Ä¢	Confetti animation.
	‚Ä¢	Share card (‚ÄúI‚Äôve completed 21 mindful mornings with Morning Momentum üåÖ‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Optional share to Instagram, Twitter, or text.
	‚Ä¢	Add referral functionality:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúInvite a friend, and both of you unlock a premium visualization track.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Track referrals using unique links.

‚∏ª

6Ô∏è‚É£ Add Event Tracking for Analytics
	‚Ä¢	Integrate PostHog or Firebase for event tracking.
	‚Ä¢	Track:
	‚Ä¢	app_open, start_day_pressed, breathing_completed, timer_started, timer_completed,
	‚Ä¢	checklist_submitted, visualization_completed, reflection_submitted,
	‚Ä¢	quick_mode_used, milestone_reached, share_clicked, referral_sent, feedback_submitted.
	‚Ä¢	Track time spent on each screen, skip rates, and completion rates.
	‚Ä¢	Store user‚Äôs chosen mode (Quick vs. Full).

‚∏ª

7Ô∏è‚É£ Maintain PWA & Performance Standards
	‚Ä¢	Retain:
	‚Ä¢	Full offline support with service workers.
	‚Ä¢	Home screen installation.
	‚Ä¢	WCAG AA accessibility standards (color contrast, ARIA labels).
	‚Ä¢	Touch targets (min. 44px) and mobile-first design.

‚∏ª

8Ô∏è‚É£ Future (Optional AI Hooks, Mark for Future Sprints)
	‚Ä¢	Mark placeholders for future:
	‚Ä¢	Personalized affirmations.
	‚Ä¢	Smart starter action suggestions.
	‚Ä¢	Reflection analysis and insight summaries.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic micro-visualization scripts.
	‚Ä¢	Include clear TODOs in the codebase for these enhancements.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Simplify and streamline user flow to reduce friction.
‚úÖ Provide flexibility with Quick Mode while maintaining habit consistency.
‚úÖ Enable organic growth with sharing and referrals.
‚úÖ Prepare structured data for continuous improvement post-launch.
