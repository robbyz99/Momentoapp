Please conduct thorough QA testing on the Morning Momentum PWA, focusing on performance optimization, consistency, and stability across all features and flows. Prioritize:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Functional Consistency Checks
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all navigation paths (including Quick Mode, Full Flow, and bottom navigation) function without dead links or navigation stack issues.
	‚Ä¢	Validate data persistence:
	‚Ä¢	Streak tracking increments correctly and resets only when appropriate.
	‚Ä¢	Quick Mode and Full Mode entries save and persist across app reloads.
	‚Ä¢	Reflection data is accurately timestamped and retrievable.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm completion flags for each section are accurately set and reflected in the UI.
	‚Ä¢	Check animations (breathing, confetti) trigger reliably and do not freeze or stutter.
	‚Ä¢	Verify onboarding flow appears only on first launch (or if reset), does not repeat unnecessarily.
	‚Ä¢	Test form validations:
	‚Ä¢	Required fields prompt gently if skipped.
	‚Ä¢	No crashes on empty or partial inputs.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Performance Testing
	‚Ä¢	Measure initial load time and ensure it is under 2 seconds on a standard 4G connection.
	‚Ä¢	Check screen transitions for smoothness (no jank or lag).
	‚Ä¢	Verify service worker caching:
	‚Ä¢	The app functions offline after first load.
	‚Ä¢	New deployments correctly update cached files without stale data issues.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm animations and SVG timers remain performant on low-end devices.
	‚Ä¢	Test memory usage during:
	‚Ä¢	Extended use (10+ minutes navigating the app).
	‚Ä¢	Switching between Quick Mode and Full Mode repeatedly.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Mobile Optimization QA
	‚Ä¢	Test on different iOS Safari and Chrome mobile viewport widths:
	‚Ä¢	320px, 375px, 414px, 768px (iPhone SE ‚Üí Pro Max ‚Üí iPad mini).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure touch targets are consistently 44px+.
	‚Ä¢	Check keyboard overlay behaviors:
	‚Ä¢	Forms scroll correctly into view.
	‚Ä¢	Input fields are not covered on smaller screens.
	‚Ä¢	Validate PWA install:
	‚Ä¢	Home screen icon appears correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Launches without browser chrome.
	‚Ä¢	Splash screen colors and icon alignment are correct.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Accessibility Consistency
	‚Ä¢	Confirm WCAG AA contrast compliance across all screens.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure ARIA labels are present on:
	‚Ä¢	Navigation icons.
	‚Ä¢	Buttons (‚ÄúStart Your Day‚Äù, ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Form inputs.
	‚Ä¢	Verify voice-over navigation correctly reads sections in order.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Edge Case Testing
	‚Ä¢	Switching network off and on while in-app:
	‚Ä¢	Does not cause crashes.
	‚Ä¢	Offline functionality persists.
	‚Ä¢	Rapidly tapping buttons does not trigger duplicate events or crashes.
	‚Ä¢	Multiple day usage with changing streaks:
	‚Ä¢	Verify streak increment, skip, and recovery flows.
	‚Ä¢	Test user missing multiple days and streak reset behavior.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Reporting Requirements

For each identified bug, please include:
‚úÖ Title (short summary)
‚úÖ Steps to reproduce
‚úÖ Expected vs. actual behavior
‚úÖ Screenshot or console log if relevant
‚úÖ Severity rating (Critical, Major, Minor)

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Optional Advanced: Lighthouse & Profiling
	‚Ä¢	Run Lighthouse audits:
	‚Ä¢	Performance
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility
	‚Ä¢	PWA compliance
	‚Ä¢	Run memory profiling to identify leaks.
	‚Ä¢	Check unused JS/CSS for bundle size optimization opportunities.

‚∏ª

üéØ Goals:

‚úÖ Ensure stable, frictionless daily use for your target users.
‚úÖ Optimize load times and runtime smoothness for mobile-first usage.
‚úÖ Confirm all data saves and retrieves consistently without corruption or unexpected resets.
‚úÖ Maintain clean UI/UX consistency and professional polish.
