# Deploying to GitHub Pages

To make this project available at <https://robbyz99.github.io/>, you can deploy the static client that gets generated by `npm run build`.

GitHub Pages only serves static files. Any server-side routes or APIs from `server/` won't be available. If your app relies on those endpoints, you'll need a separate hosting solution for the backend.

Steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run build` to create the production files in `dist/public/`.
3. Create a new repository named `robbyz99.github.io` on your GitHub account (or rename this one).
4. Run `npm run deploy` to push the contents of `dist/public/` to that repository's `main` branch.
5. Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings. After a few minutes the site will be served at `https://robbyz99.github.io/`.

The `deploy` script uses the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) tool to automatically publish the static build. Ensure you have write access to the `robbyz99.github.io` repository before running it.
