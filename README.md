# Deploying to GitHub Pages

To make this project available at <https://robbyz99.github.io/>, you can deploy the static client that gets generated by `npm run build`.

GitHub Pages only serves static files. Any server-side routes or APIs from `server/` won't be available. If your app relies on those endpoints, you'll need a separate hosting solution for the backend.

Steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run build` to create the production files in `dist/public/`.
3. Create a new repository named `robbyz99.github.io` on your GitHub account.
4. Copy the contents of `dist/public/` into that repository's root and push.
5. Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings. The site will then be served at `https://robbyz99.github.io/`.
